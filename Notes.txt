Seq lazyness is useful during generation

remove need for fsharpx
	don't use monadic state updater

ensure drawing is in the gui thread

in this style
	when to use mutable, immutable and concurrent collections    
		immutable for snapshots and understandability/safety generally
		concurrent for producer consumer
		mutable only use within a function
		using mutable types, that don't escape a function, is a safe as using immutable types

core 100% immutable
allow going backwards in time
